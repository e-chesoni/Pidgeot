AR: (faster) 0.6 - 0.7 (larger)
adding simple flap = top curve of NACA graph on left

Landing speed
- acceleration * 60m
- a = 0.4
- (0.4) * (60m) (2) = V_L^2
- ~24m/s landing speed

Tail sizing
- Can look up tail sizing for different set_trimmed_drag_polar_coefficients
- V_H = l_t * S_t / c * S ~ 0.5
- 0.3 - 0.1

Want full plane cg close to quarter chord on wing
